For using QEPCAD you have setup an environment variable qe. Copy (or
symbolically link) the qepcad.awk from here into that directory $qe.

There is now an interface to the simplifier SLFQ for large
quantifier-free formulas, which is based on QEPCAD and distributed on
the QEPCAD website.

Make sure that the directories containing qepcad/slfq are in the path of
your shell.
