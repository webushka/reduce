This is an interface between Reduce/CSL and the Cuba library for
multi-dimensional numerical integration by a choice of methods.
See http://www.feynarts.de/cuba.

Cuba itself evaluates all integrals over the unit hypercube, but the Reduce
interface provides a small extension, allowing the user to integrate over an 
arbitrary hyper-rectangle.

Installation instructions are in cuba.pdf.
