The idea of this directory is that it is a place to put test scripts and
corresponding output as a record when a bug is corrected. The protocol
will be that files here come in pairs
     testcase.tst         free-standing tesst script
     testcase.rlg         corresponding CORRECT output
I suggest that file-names include a date and that test scripts start
with a comment that explains what big was fixed. I will put a sample
initial one in.

It is IMPORTANT that the file-name selected should not be the same as
the name of any other package or test file, because if that did happen it
could confuse some of the automated testing tools.

Because there is a reference log the test script does not HAVE to
check and validate its own output, however when convenient that could
be seen as good form.
