# This is called as
#    run appname scriptname args

# apname is bpsl scriptname will be redpsl. These are not at present
# actually varied ever!

# I want this script to be one I can launch from anywhere, but at least
# some of its sub-scripts will not be so generous. So find out where it
# lives so that other locations can be found relative to that.
