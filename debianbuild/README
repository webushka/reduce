package for REDUCE. To use it, you should have already installed the 
package

  devscripts

To build the package, run the following command from the debianbuild
directory:

  debuild -B -uc -us

After successful completion, you cmay check the package content with

  dpkg --contents reduce_3.9_i386.deb

Install the package with

  dpkg --install reduce_3.9_i386.deb

An rpm package can be built from this by running (You need Ubuntu packages 
fakeroot and alien)

and 
  
  /usr/bin/redcsl

respectively.
