JLISP

This code is now OLD and NOT SUPPORTED.

Anybody who wishes to use it can hack it for themselves. It dates at
best from the times of Reduce version 3.7 and it HAS NOT been updated to
reflect the file layout and so on of the current Open Source system or
to incorporate package contributed since Reduce 3.7.

To try it you may just try
   java -jar jlisp.jar
to use a pre-built version!

Good luck. Please tell me if you get anywhere bringing this up to date.
