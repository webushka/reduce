// This is a rather small sample X program that is here
// just to let me verify that I can compile something. When I
// was first writing it I looked on the web and in the X11 documentation
// and the most helpful code snippet I found was on www.rosettacode.org.
// The code here may have moved on far enough that it is not merely a copy
// of what I found there, but I will still express my thanks here!

// I think that "Hello World" scale programs perhaps berely need explicit
// licenses, since their contents are so much defined by the requirement of
// functionality. however anything I have put here I make available to others
// under the modified BSD license.
