This is a branch of "cslbase" but it intended to provide a kit from which
a CSL version of Reduce can be made with the least possible complication
and with the least reasonable reliance on system support. It assumes that
the generated files u01.c to u12.c and reduce.img have already been created
using a full version of the system (so it includes ready-built copies here).
It does not provide a GUI or any other clevers. It is expected that it JUST
needs a bunch of files of C code to be compiled and linked together. You
should not expect "help" capability etc, but the ALGEBRA bits of Reduce
should work the way they always have.

All custmisations here should be guarded by "#if(n)def EMBEDDED". And the
*.h and *.c files that are in this directory should eventually be
exectly the same as the ones in cslbase. Just this set has a ready-build
reduce.img file, a set of u01,c to u12.c, and its own private and vey
simple Makefile
