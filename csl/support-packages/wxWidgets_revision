The revision of wxWidgets that I have based my private version on is 77757.

This file records that fact and is used by "make" so that when its date
stamp changes a fresh copy of wxWidgets will be unpacked for use. There is
no check that the revision number quoted here matches the one that gets
unpacked, but the number included here guarantees a textual change in the file
any time I update things.
