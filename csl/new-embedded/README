This is a kit from which a CSL version of Reduce can be made with the least
possible complication and with the least reasonable reliance on system
support. It builds in a way that might suit small platforms, and so will be
slower than the normal version of reduce.
It does not provide a GUI or any other clevers. It is expected that it JUST
needs a bunch of files of C code to be compiled and linked together. You
should not expect "help" capability etc, but the ALGEBRA bits of Reduce
should work the way they always have.

I hope it wiull end up with recipes to cross-compile or custom-build Reduce
for a variety of interesting situations.

The reduce-image directory builds a version of Reduce on the current computer
(whatever that is) and uses it to cread a file "reduce.img". This image file
will be needed by all other variants here.
