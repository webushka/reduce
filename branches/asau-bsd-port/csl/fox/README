This is a patched and extended version of FOX 1.6.21.

The original FOX distribution comes with an addendum to the license that
permits use of binaries linked with an UNMODIFIED version of the library
under very flexible terms. The author of FOX has made it clear that his intent
is that that extension only applies to versions explicitly sanctioned by him,
and so any bug-fixes or extensions made by others may not be released by
those authors in a way that allows the derived work to take advantage of the
addendum, however public the changes are, unless and until he chooses to
adopt them.

Thus it is important to make it explicit here that even if you have seen the
FOX library addendum somewhere else I have deleted the file containing it
in this copy and the code here is thus released under just LGPL.

I will observe that the original versions of the FOX library in versions up
to 1.6 are marked as being available under "LGPL 2.1 or later at your choice".
I choose to redistribute them here under version 2.1 of that license and the
changes and extensions that I make are only licensed under LGPL 2.1 and so
without further agreement from me may not be treated as being convertable
to LGPL 3, and the static linking exception does not apply to my changes or
contributions.

However as a special exception to LGPL 2.1 I grant permission for *MY* code
to be merged or linked with other code that is subject to LGPL version 3 or
GPL version 3. This provision does not represent permission to alter the
license of my code to be that of LGPL 3 or GPL 3 - of itself and when removed
from any LGPL 3 context it remains LGPL 2.1 and the freedom enshrined by that
can not be reduced by adding in the additional constraints that LGPL 3 views
as protections. However clearly the combined work that then includes my work
would be subject to "3". But as per LGPL 2.1 (and the same would be true if
I had used a BSD-style license here) notices explaining the license terms
related to my code should not be removed. Anybody who changes or extends my
code is permitted but not obliged to apply this exception, and perhaps by doing
do they do not lock out (L)GPL 3 users but guarantee continued support for
(L)GPL 2.1 in a way that the "or later" clause does not (since that permits
anybody to unilaterally select just one version of the library to use, to the
potential detriment of those whose choice differs).

As compared with the original FOX 1.6 archive I have removed the various
sample applications that were included but that did not form part of the
FOX *library*, since in general they are not relevant for the purposes
I have here and they are subject to more restrictive license terms.

The end effect is that anybody who wishes to convey, propagate, distribute,
give, sell or in any other way provide a copy of any binary that is made
using any file from this directory should ensure that a copy of this
directory is also made available. Please consult the exact terms of the
LGPL 2.1 and adhere to them carefully. But the source code and build
files in this directory are clearly sufficient to create the library in the
form that I use it (because that is exactly what I do) and so those files
contain within them the "minimal source" as required.

Note that if you want to use the FOX library for purposes other than the use
I make here you may do better fetching a copy from the main FOX web-site,
where more updates and upgrades are liable to be available. This is in effect
a rather frozen version.

                                The FOX GUI Library
                                ===================

What Is FOX?
============

FOX is a C++ based Toolkit for developing Graphical User Interfaces easily and
effectively.   It offers a wide, and growing, collection of Controls, and provides
state of the art facilities such as drag and drop, selection, as well as OpenGL widgets
for 3D graphical manipulation.  FOX also implements icons, images, and user-convenience
features such as status line help, and tooltips.  Tooltips may even be used for 3D
objects!

Considerable importance has been placed on making FOX one of the fastest toolkits
around, and to minimize memory use:- FOX uses a number of techniques to speed up drawing
and spatial layout of the GUI.  Memory is conserved by allowing programmers to create
and destroy GUI elements on the fly.

Even though FOX offers a large collection of Controls already, FOX leverages C++ to
allow programmers to easily build additional Controls and GUI elements, simply by taking
existing controls, and creating a derived class which simply adds or redefines the
desired behavior.

One of the prime design goals of FOX is the ease of programming; thus, most controls
can be created using a single line of C++ code; most parameters have sensible default
values, so that they may be omitted, and layout managers ensure that designers of GUI's
do not have to worry about precise alignments.

Another nice feature of FOX which significantly reduces the number of lines of code
which have to be written is FOX's ability to have widgets connect to each other, and
passing certain commands between them; for example, a menu entry Hide Toolbar can be
directly connected to the Toolbar, and cause it to hide.

Finally, FOX makes it easy to maintain the state of the GUI in an application by having
the GUI elements automatically updating themselves by interrogating the application's
state.  This feature eliminates the large amount of effort that may go into sensitizing,
graying out, checking/unchecking etc. depending on the application state.



Where to get it?
================

You can FTP the complete FOX GUI toolkit from our FTP site:


	ftp://ftp.fox-toolkit.org/pub/


The distribution includes this on-line (HTML) documentation you see here.


Mailing List.
=============

To stay informed, we now have a mailing list for FOX.  To subscribe, send mail to
foxgui-users-request@lists.sourceforge.net with the word subscribe in the message body.
Messages to the list can be sent to foxgui-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
FOX announcements will be made through the foxgui-announce@lists.sourceforge.net list;
you can subscribe to this list by sending a message "subscribe" to the list server at
foxgui-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net.


Installation.
=============

Please refer to the file INSTALL.  FOX should compile on a large number of UNIX
systems.  The current "configure" scripts are however still somewhat primitive;
if you need to make specific alterations to the configure system, feel free to
send them to me so that I may merge them into the main distribution.
The current FOX distribution compiles on Windows NT using the eXceed system; we
expect however to get some core functionality to become available under the native
Windows environment fairly soon.



Getting started.
================

To get started programming with FOX, take a look at the tests directory, which contains
some example programs.  The best one to look at is probably the "glviewer" application.
Note that you need OpenGL or Mesa on your machine in order to compile it.



Finding FOX using GNU configure.
================================

GNU auto configure has features to detect the whereabouts of a library (AC_CHECK_LIB).
Unfortunately, it assumes that you're looking for a C library, not a C++ library,
and thus name mangling prevents it from finding FOX as all of FOX's API are C++.

A special "dummy" C-linkage function was created to allow GNU auto configure to
find the FOX library; you can use it in your configure.in as follows:


        AC_CHECK_LIB(FOX, fxfindfox)




Bugs.
=====

Please file bugs and questions to the list foxgui-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Before
filing a bug, please take a moment to download the latest version of FOX, and make sure
the problem still persists:- FOX is being developed fairly rapidly, and it is possible
that some of the problems you may have experienced have already been fixed.



License.
========

The FOX Library proper is licensed under GNU Lesser GPL; all the examples and demo
programs are licensed under GPL.

If you write software based on the FOX library, please include the following in your
About Box, or some other place where a user may be able to see it:


        This software uses the FOX Toolkit (http://www.fox-toolkit.org).
        


Thanks!
