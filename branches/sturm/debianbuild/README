This directory contains everything necessary to build Debian/Ubuntu
packages for REDUCE. To use it, you should have already installed the 
package

  devscripts

To build the packages, run the following command from the debianbuild/reduce
directory:

  debuild -b -uc -us

After successful completion, you should have three .deb package files for
CSL, PSL and common files, respectively.

You may check the package content with, e.g.,

  dpkg --contents reduce-common_20120514_i386.deb

Install the package with

  dpkg --install reduce-common_20120514_i386.deb

Rpm packagies can be built from this by running (You need Ubuntu packages 
fakeroot and alien)

 fakeroot alien -r -k reduce-*.deb

The CSL and PSL versions of REDUCE are run with

  /usr/bin/redpsl 

and 
  
  /usr/bin/redcsl

respectively.
