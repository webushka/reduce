How to build the manual from source.
====================================

There are two scripts:

 mkpdf.sh   -- creates a PDF file using pdflatex
 mkhtml.sh  -- creates a HTML version using TeX4ht

Prerequisites are:
 1. a TeX installation, including pdflatex and makeindex (ie a standard TeX)
 2. TeX4ht (see http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html)

The file reduce.cfg contains the necessary configuration lines for TeX4ht.
