\chapter{User Contributed Packages} \index{User packages}
\label{chap-user}
The complete {\REDUCE} system includes a number of packages contributed by
users that are provided as a service to the user community.  Questions
regarding these packages should be directed to their individual authors.

All such packages have been precompiled as part of the installation process.
However, many must be specifically loaded before they can be used. (Those
that are loaded automatically are so noted in their description.) You should
also consult the user notes for your particular implementation for further
information on whether this is necessary.  If it is, the relevant command is
\f{LOAD\_PACKAGE},\ttindex{LOAD\_PACKAGE} which takes a list of one or
more package names as argument, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
        load_package algint;
\end{verbatim}
although this syntax may vary from implementation to implementation.

Nearly all these packages come with separate documentation and test files
(except those noted here that have no additional documentation), which is
included, along with the source of the package, in the {\REDUCE} system
distribution.  These items should be studied for any additional details on
the use of a particular package.

The packages available in the current release of {\REDUCE} are as follows:

\section{ALGINT: Integration of square roots} \ttindex{ALGINT}
\label{ALGINT}

This package, which is an extension of the basic integration package
distributed with {\REDUCE}, will analytically integrate a wide range of
expressions involving square roots where the answer exists in that class
of functions. It is an implementation of the work described in J.H.
Davenport, ``On the Integration of Algebraic Functions", LNCS 102,
Springer Verlag, 1981.  Both this and the source code should be consulted
for a more detailed description of this work.

\hypertarget{switch:ALGINT}{}
The \texttt{ALGINT} package is loaded automatically when the switch \sw{ALGINT}
is turned on.  
One enters an expression for integration, as with the regular integrator,
for example:
\begin{verbatim}
        int(sqrt(x+sqrt(x**2+1))/x,x);
\end{verbatim}
If one later wishes to integrate expressions without using the facilities of
this package, the switch \sw{ALGINT} \ttindex{ALGINT} should be turned
off. 

\hypertarget{switch:TRA}{}
The switches supported by the standard integrator (e.g., \sw{TRINT})
\ttindex{TRINT} are also supported by this package.  In addition, the
switch \sw{TRA}, \ttindex{TRA} if on, will give further tracing
information about the specific functioning of the algebraic integrator.

There is no additional documentation for this package.

\section{GUARDIAN: Guarded Expressions in Practice}
\ttindex{GUARDIAN}\label{GUARDIAN}

Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate cases when
evaluating expressions, e.g., $x/x$ becomes $1$ dropping the case
$x=0$. We claim that it is feasible in practice to compute also the
degenerate cases yielding {\em guarded expressions}. We work over real
closed fields but our ideas about handling guarded expression can be
easily transferred to other situations. Using formulas as guards
provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial
explosion of cases: equivalent, redundant, tautological, and
contradictive cases can be detected by simplification and quantifier
elimination. Our approach allows to simplify the expressions on the
basis of simplification knowledge on the logical side. The method
described in this paper is implemented in the {\sc reduce} package
{\sc guardian}.

Authors: Andreas Dolzmann and Thomas Sturm.

\section{IDEALS: Arithmetic for polynomial ideals} \ttindex{IDEALS}

construction of involutive bases reduces the problem of solving polynomial
systems to simple linear algebra.

\begin{verbatim}
on modular; setmod 8;
m_solve(2x=4);            ->  {{X=2},{X=6}}
m_solve({x^2-y^3=3});
    ->  {{X=0,Y=5}, {X=2,Y=1}, {X=4,Y=5}, {X=6,Y=1}}
m_solve({x=2,x^2-y^3=3}); ->  {{X=2,Y=1}}
off modular;
m_roots(x^2-1,8);         ->  {1,3,5,7}

\section[ODESOLVE: Ordinary differential equations solver]%
        {ODESOLVE: \protect\\ Ordinary differential equations solver}
\ttindex{ODESOLVE}

The ODESOLVE package is a solver for ordinary differential equations.  At
the present time it has very limited capabilities.  It can handle only a
single scalar equation presented as an algebraic expression or equation,
and it can solve only first-order equations of simple types, linear
equations with constant coefficients and Euler equations.  These solvable
types are exactly those for which Lie symmetry techniques give no useful
information.  For example, the evaluation of
\begin{verbatim}
        depend(y,x);
        odesolve(df(y,x)=x**2+e**x,y,x);
\end{verbatim}
yields the result
\begin{verbatim}
               X                    3
            3*E  + 3*ARBCONST(1) + X
        {Y=---------------------------}

\index{Generalized Hypergeometric functions} 
\index{Meijer's G function}

This package provides algebraic manipulations of generalized
hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G function.  Generalized
hypergeometric functions are simplified towards special functions and
Meijer's G function is simplified towards special functions or generalized
hypergeometric functions.

Author: Victor Adamchik, with major updates by Winfried Neun.

\section{SUM: A package for series summation} \ttindex{SUM}
\hypertarget{operator:SUM}{}
\hypertarget{operator:PROD}{}

This package implements the Gosper algorithm for the summation of series.
It defines operators {\tt SUM} and {\tt PROD}.  The operator {\tt SUM}
returns the indefinite or definite summation of a given expression, and
{\tt PROD} returns the product of the given expression.

This package loads automatically.

Author: Fujio Kako.

\section{SYMMETRY: Operations on symmetric matrices} \ttindex{SYMMETRY}

This package computes symmetry-adapted bases and block diagonal forms of
matrices which have the symmetry of a group.  The package is the
implementation of the theory of linear representations for small finite
groups such as the dihedral groups.

Author: Karin Gatermann.

\section{TAYLOR: Manipulation of Taylor series}
\ttindex{TAYLOR}
\index{Taylor Series} \index{TAYLOR package}
\index{Laurent series} \index{Puiseux series}

This package carries out the Taylor expansion of an expression in one or
more variables and efficient manipulation of the resulting Taylor series.
Capabilities include basic operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) and also application of certain algebraic and
transcendental functions.

Author: Rainer Sch\"opf.

\input{taylor}

\section{TPS: A truncated power series package} \ttindex{TPS} \ttindex{PS}

This package implements formal Laurent series expansions in one variable
using the domain mechanism of REDUCE.  This means that power series
objects can be added, multiplied, differentiated etc.,  like other first
class objects in the system.  A lazy evaluation scheme is used and thus
terms of the series are not evaluated until they are required for printing
or for use in calculating terms in other power series.  The series are
extendible giving the user the impression that the full infinite series is
being manipulated.  The errors that can sometimes occur using series that
are truncated at some fixed depth (for example when a term in the required
series depends on terms of an intermediate series beyond the truncation
depth) are thus avoided.

Authors:  Alan Barnes and Julian Padget.

\section{TRI: TeX REDUCE interface} \ttindex{TRI}

This package provides facilities written in REDUCE-Lisp for typesetting
REDUCE formulas using \TeX.  The \TeX-REDUCE-Interface incorporates three
levels of \TeX output: without line breaking, with line breaking, and
with line breaking plus indentation.

Author: Werner Antweiler.

\section{TRIGSIMP: Simplification and factorization of trigonometric
and hyperbolic functions} \ttindex{TRIGSIMP}
\label{TRIGSIMP}

TRIGSIMP is a useful tool for all kinds of trigonometric and hyperbolic
simplification and factorization.  There are three procedures included in
TRIGSIMP: trigsimp, trigfactorize and triggcd.  The first is for finding
simplifications of trigonometric or hyperbolic expressions with many
options, the second for factorizing them and the third for finding the
greatest common divisor of two trigonometric or hyperbolic polynomials.

Author: Wolfram Koepf.

\section{WU: Wu algorithm for polynomial systems} \ttindex{WU}

This is a simple implementation of the Wu algorithm implemented in REDUCE
working directly from ``A Zero Structure Theorem for
Polynomial-Equations-Solving,'' Wu Wen-tsun, Institute of Systems Science,
Academia Sinica, Beijing.

Author: Russell Bradford.

\section{XCOLOR: Color factor in some field theories}
\ttindex{XCOLOR}

This package calculates the color factor in non-abelian gauge field
theories using an algorithm due to Cvitanovich.

Documentation for this package is in plain text.

Author: A. Kryukov.

\section{XIDEAL: Gr\"obner Bases for exterior algebra} \ttindex{XIDEAL}

XIDEAL constructs Gr\"obner bases for solving the left ideal membership
problem: Gr\"obner left ideal bases or GLIBs. For graded ideals, where each
form is homogeneous in degree, the distinction between left and right
ideals vanishes. Furthermore, if the generating forms are all homogeneous,
then the Gr\"obner bases for the non-graded and graded ideals are
identical. In this case, XIDEAL is able to save time by truncating the
Gr\"obner basis at some maximum degree if desired.

Author: David Hartley.

\section{ZEILBERG: Indefinite and definite summation}
\ttindex{ZEILBERG}

This package is a careful implementation of the Gosper and Zeilberger
algorithms for indefinite and definite summation of hypergeometric terms,
respectively.  Extensions of these algorithms are also included that are
valid for ratios of products of powers, factorials, $\Gamma$ function
terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted factorials that are
rational-linear in their arguments.
