This directory contains PSL binaries.
=====================================

Do not re-distribute without checking with ZIB (neun@zib.de).


There are two sorts of things here. Firstly there are a bunch of directories
with names like psl-amd64 and psl-win32 that contain ready-built binaries
of a basic kermel version of PSL.

Then there are a load of script and related files used for re-building REDUCE
in a PSL world.
