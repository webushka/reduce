Status report March 2009
========================

This file contains a collection of little directories with names such as
psl-win32 etc. Each basically contains a file "xport,pat". The directory
"support-packages" contains a utility "xport" that can process this and that
fetches a set of PSL binaries from a web-site as specified in xport.pat.

The PSL build scripts arrange to compile xport and use it in such a way that
the PSL binaries relevant to you computer get fetched and placed within
the pslbuild subdirectory at the top level here.

All this arrangement is because we do not yet have the PSL sources in a tidy
state for release - and that includes getting them in a state where the
associated build-scripts are all easy to use and everything has been at
least reasonably checked. It is hoped that in a while there will be a PSL
source release, but at present this is not generally available. But the
current arrangements should allow the PSL version of Reduce to be built
and used.
