This is the VSL Lisp system. Its key attribute is that it is SMALL.
The source file (vsl.c) is around 3000 lines long, but despite that
the system can build and run much of Reduce. Since there is only
an interpreter it will be slow, but for teaching purposes and for
fun it may still be of interest.

As always with things like this I would view it as nice if a couple of
people were willing to join in debugging and getting this straight with
me.
