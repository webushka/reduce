\section{Introduction}
This is reference material for CSL. The Lisp identifiers mentioned here are
the ones that are initially present in a raw CSL image. Some proportion of them
are not really intended to be used by end-users but are merely the
internal components of some feature.

\section{Command-line options}

The items shown here are the ones that are recognized on the CSL command
line. In general an option that requires an argument can be written as either
{\ttfamily -x yyy} or as {\ttfamily -xyyy}. Arguments should be case
insensitive. 

\subsection{\ttfamily -a}
{\ttfamily -a} is a curious option, not intended for general or casual use.
If given it causes the {\ttfamily (batchp)} function to return the opposite
result from normal!  Without ``{attfamily -a}'' {\ttfamily (batchp)} returns
{\ttfamily T} either if at least one file was specified on the command line,
or if the standard input is ``not a tty'' (under some operating systems this
makes sense -- for instance the standard input might not be a ``tty'' if it
is provided via file redirection).  Otherwise (ie primary input is directly
from a keyboard) {\ttfamily (batchp)} returns {\ttfamily nil}.  Sometimes
this judgement about how ``batch'' the current run is will be wrong or
unhelpful, so {\ttfamily -a} allows the user to coax the system into better
behaviour.  I hope that this is never used!

\subsection{\ttfamily -b}
{\ttfamily -b} tells the system to avoid any attempt to recolour prompts and
input text. It will mainly be needed on X terminals that have been set up
so that they use colours that make the defaults here unhelpful.
Specifically white-on-black and so on.

{\ttfamily -b} can be followed by colour specifications to make things yet
more specific. It is supposed to be the idea that three colours can be
specified after it for output, input and prompts, with the letters KRGYbMCW
standing for blacK, Red, Green, Yellow, blue, Magenta, Cyan and White. This may
not fully work yet!

\subsection{\ttfamily -c}
Displays a notice retalting to the authorship of CSL.
\subsection{\ttfamily -d}
A command line entry {\ttfamily -Dname=value} or {\ttfamily -D name=value}
sets the value of the named lisp variable to the value (as a string).
\subsection{\ttfamily -e}
A ``spare'' option used from tim eto time to activate experiments within CSL.
\subsection{\ttfamily -f}
At one stage CSL could run as a socket server, and {\ttfamily -f portnumber}
activated that mode. {\ttfamily -f-} used a default port, 1206 (a number
inspired by an account number on Titan that I used in the 1960s). The code
that supports this may be a useful foundation to others who want to make a
network service out of this code-base.
\subsection{\ttfamily -g}
In line with the implication of this option for C compilers, this enables
a debugging mode. It sets a lisp variable {\ttfamily !*backtrace} and arranges
that all backtraces are displayed notwithstanding use of {\ttfamily errorset}.
\subsection{\ttfamily -h}
This option is a left-over. When the X-windows version of the code first
started to use Xft it viewed that as optional and could allow a build even when
it was not available. And then even if Xft was detected and liable to be used
by default it provided this option to disable its use. The remnants of the
switch that disabled use of Xft (relating to fonts living on the Host or
the Server) used this switch, but it now has no effect.
\subsection{\ttfamily -i}
CSL and Reduce use image files to keep both initial heap images and
``fasl'' loadable modules. By default if the executable launched has some name,
say xxx, then an image file xxx.img is used. But to support greater
generality {\ttfamily -i} introduces a new image, {\ttfamily -i-} indicates
the default one and a sequence of such directives list image files that are
searched in the order given. These are read-only. The similar option
{\ttfamily -o} equally introduces image files that are scanned for input, but
that can also be used for output. Normally there would only be one
{\ttfamily -o} directive.
\subsection{\ttfamily -j}
Follow this directive with a file-name, and a record of all the files read
during the Lisp run will be dumped there with a view that it can be included
in a Makefile to document dependencies.
\subsection{\ttfamily -k}
{\ttfamily -K nnn} sets the size of heap to be used.  If it is given then that much
memory will be allocated and the heap will never expand.  Without this
option a default amount is used, and (on many machines) it will grow
if space seems tight.

The extended version of this option is {\ttfamily -K nnn/ss} and then ss is the
number of ``CSL pages'' to be allocated to the Lisp stack. The default
value (which is 1) should suffice for almost all users, and it should
be noted that the C stack is separate from and independent of this one and
it too could overflow.

A suffix K, M or G on the number indicates units of kilobytes, megabytes or
gigabytes, with megabytes being the default. So {\ttfamily -K200M} might
represent typical usage.
\subsection{\ttfamily -l}
This is to send a copy of the standard output to a named log file. It is
very much as if the Lisp function {\ttfamily (spool ``logfile'')} had been
invoked at the start of the run.
\subsection{\ttfamily -m}
Memory trace mode. An option that represents an experiment from the past,
and no longer reliably in use.
\subsection{\ttfamily -n}
Normally when the system is started it will run a ``restart function'' as
indicated in its heap image. There can be cases where a heap image has been
created in a bad way such that the saved restart function always fails
abruptly, and hence working out what was wrong becomes hard. In such cases
it may be useful to give the {\ttfamily -n} option that forces CSL to
ignore any startup function and merely always begin in a minimal Lisp-style
read-eval-print loop.
\subsection{\ttfamily -o}
See {\ttfamily -i}.
\subsection{\ttfamily -p}
If a suitable profile option gets implemented one day this will activate it,
but for now it has no effect.
\subsection{\ttfamily -q}
This option sets {\ttfamily !*echo} to {\ttfamily nil} and switches off
garbage collector messages to give a slightly quieter run.
\subsection{\ttfamily -r}
The random-number generator in CSL is normally initialised to a value
based on the time of day and is hence not reproducible from run to run.
In many cases that behavious is desirable, but for debugging it can be useful
to force a seed. The directive {\ttfamily -r nnn,mmm} sets the seed to
up to 64 bits taken from the values nnn and mmm. The second value if optional,
and specifying {\ttfamily -r0}  explicitly asks for the non-reproducible
behaviour (I hope). Note that the main Reduce-level random number source is
coded at a higher level and does not get reset this way -- this is the
lower level CSL generator.
\subsection{\ttfamily -s}
Sets the Lisp variable {\ttfamily !*plap} and hence the compiler generates
an assembly listing.
\subsection{\ttfamily -t}
{\ttfamily -t name} reports the time-stamp on the named module, and then
exits. This is for use in perl scripts and the like, and is
needed because the stamps on modules within an image or
library file are not otherwise instantly available.

Note that especially on windowed systems it may be necessary to use this
with {\ttfamily -- filename} since the information generated here goes to
the default output, which in some cases is just the screen.
\subsection{\ttfamily -u}
See {\ttfamily -d}, but this forcibly undefines a symbol. There are probably
very very few cases where it is useful since I do not have a large
number of system-specific predefined names.
\subsection{\ttfamily -v}
An option to make things mildly more verbose. It displays more of a banner
at startup and switches garbage collection messages on.
\subsection{\ttfamily -w}
On a typical system if the system is launched it creates a new window and uses
its own windowed intarface in that. If it is run such that at startup the
standard input or output are associated with a file or pipe, or under X the
variable {\ttfamily DISPLAY} is not set it will try to start up in console
mode. The flag {\ttfamily -w} indicates that the system should run in console
more regadless, while {\ttfamily -w+} attempts a window even if that seems
doomed to failure. When running the system to obey a script it will often make
sense to use the {\ttfamily -w} option. Note that on Windows the system is
provided as two separate (but almost identical) binaries. For example the
file {\ttfamily csl.exe} is linked in windows mode. A result is that if
launched from the command line it detaches from its console, and if launched
by double-clicking it does not create a console. It is in fact very ugly when
double clicking on an application causes an unwanted console window to appear.
In contrast {\ttfamily csl.com} is a console mode version of just the same
program, so when launched from a command line it can communicate with the
console in the ordinary expected manner.
\subsection{\ttfamily -x}
{\ttfamily -x} is an option intended for use only by system
support experts -- it disables trapping if segment violations by
errorset and so makes it easier to track down low level disasters --
maybe!  This can be valuable when running under a debugger since if the
code traps signals in its usual way and tries to recover it can make it a lot
harder to find out just what was going wrong.
\subsection{\ttfamily -y}
{\ttfamily -y } sets the variable {\ttfamily !*hankaku}, which causes the
lisp reader convert a Zenkaku code to Hankaku one when read. I leave this
option decoded on the command line even if the Kanji support code is not
otherwise compiled into CSL just so I can reduce conditional compilation.
This was part of the Internationalisation effort for CSL bu this is no longer
supported. 
\subsection{\ttfamily -z}
When bootstrapping it is necessary to start up the system for one initial time
without the benefit of any image file at all. The option {\ttfamily -z} makes
this happen, so when it is specified the system starts up with a minimal
environment and only those capabilities that are present in the CSL
kernel. It will normally make sense to start loading some basic Lisp
definitions rather rapidly. The files {\ttfamily compat.lsp},
{\ttfamily extras.lsp} and {\ttfamily compiler.lsp} have Lisp source for the
main things I use, and once they are loaded the Lisp compiler can be used
to compile itself.
\subsection{\ttfamily --help}
It is probably obvious what this option does! But in particular it displays
and explantion of the {\ttfamily --dump-source} option, and hence should
count as a prominent and easy-to-find way of alerting people to their rights
and obligations. Note that on Windows of the application was linked as a
windows binary it carefully creates a console to display the help text
in, and organizes a delay to give people a chance to read it.
\subsection{\ttfamily --my-path}
At some time I had felt the need for this option, but I now forget what I
expected to use it for! It leads the executable to display the fully
rooted name of the directory it was in and then terminate. It may be useful
in some script?
\subsection{\ttfamily --texmacs}
If CSL/Reduce is launched from texmacs this command-line flag should be
used to arrange that the {\ttfamily texmacs} flag is set in
{\ttfamily lispsystem!*}, and the code may then do special things.
\subsection{\ttfamily --}
If the application is run in console mode then its standard output could
be redirected to a file using shell facilities. But the {\ttfamily --}
directive (followed by a file name) redirects output within the Lisp rather
than outside it. If this is done a very limited capability for sending
progress or status reports to stderr (or the title-bar when running in windowed
mode) remains via the {\ttfamily report!-right} function.

The {\ttfamily -w} option may frequently make sense in such cases, but if that
is not used and the system tries to run in a window it will create it
starting off minimised.

\section{Predefined variables}

\subsection{\ttfamily !!fleps1}
There is a function safe!-fp!-plus that performs floating point
arithmetic but guarantees never to raise an exception. This value was
at one stage related to when small values created there got truncated to zero,
but the current code does not use the Lisp variable at all and instead does
things based on the bitwise representation of the numbers.
\subsection{\ttfamily !\$eof!\$}
The value of this variable is a special ``character'' used to denote an
end-of-file condition.

\subsection{\ttfamily !\$eol!\$}
The value of this variable is an end-of-line character.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*applyhook!*}
If this is set it might be supposed to be the name of a function used
by the interpreter as a callbackm but at presnet it does not actually do
anything!
\subsection{\ttfamily !*break!-loop!*}
If the value of this is a symbol that is defined as a function of one
argument then it is called during the processing on an error. This has not
been used in anger and so its whole status may be dubious!
\subsection{\ttfamily !*carcheckflag}
In general CSL arranges that every {\ttfamily car} or {\ttfamily cdr} access
is checked for validity. Once upon a time setting this variable to nil
turned such checks off in the hope of gaining a little speed. But it no
longer does that. It may have a minor effect on array access primitives.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*comp}
When set each function is compiled (into bytecodes) as it gets defined.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*debug!-io!*}
An I/O channel intended to be used for diagnostic interactions.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*echo}
When this is non-nil characters that are read from an input file are
echoed to the standard output. This gives a more comlete transcript in
a log file, but can sometimes amount to over-verbose output.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*error!-messages!*}
Has the value nil and does not do anything!
\subsection{\ttfamily !*error!-output!*}
An I/O channel intended for diagnostic output.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*evalhook!*}
See {\ttfamily !*applyhool!*}. This also does not do anything at present.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*gc!-hook!*}
If this is set to have as its value that is a function of one argument then
that function is called with {\ttfamily nil} on every minor entry to the
garbage collection, and with argument {\ttfamily t} at the end of a ``genuine''
full garbage collection.
\subsection{\ttfamily !*hankaku}
This was concerned with internationalisation to support a Japanese
locale but has not been activated for some while.

Probably not used at present.

\section{Items that can appear in {\ttfamily lispsystem!*}}

There is a global variable called {\ttfamily lispsystem!*} whose value is
reset in the process of CSL starting up. An effect of this is that if the
user changes its value those changes do not survice a preserving and
re-loading a heap image: this is deliberate since the heap image may be
re-loaded on a different instance of CSL possibly on a quite different
computer of with a different configuration. The value of {\ttfamily
lispsystem!*} is a list of items, where each item is either an atomic tag
of a pair whose first component is a key. In general it would be unwise
to rely on exactly what information is present without review of the code
that sets it up. The information may be of interest to anybody but some tags
and keys are reflections of experiments rather than fullt stable facilities.

\subsection{\ttfamily (c!-code . count)}
This will be present if code has been optimised into C through the source
files u01.c to u12.c, and in that case the value tells you how many functions
have been optimised in this manner.

\subsection{\ttfamily common!-lisp}
For a project some while ago a limited Common Lisp compatibility mode was
being developed, and this tag indicated that it was active. In that case all
entries are in upper case and the variable is called {\ttfamily *FEATURES*}
rather than {\ttfamily lispsystem!*}. But note that this Lisp has never even
aspired to be a full Common Lisp, since its author considers Common Lisp to
have been a sad mistake that must bear significant responsibility for the
fact that interest in Lisp has faded dramatically since its introduction.

\subsection{\ttfamily (compiler!-command . command)}
The value associated with this key is a string that was used to compile the
files of C code making up CSL. It should contain directives to set up
search paths and predefined symbols. It is intended to be used in an
experiment that generates C code synamically, uses a command based on this
string to compile it and then dynamically links the resulting code in with
the running system.
\subsection{\ttfamily csl}
A simple tag intended to indicate that this Lisp system is CSL and not any
other. This can of course only work properly if all other Lisp systems
agree not to set this tag! In the context of Reduce I note that the PSL
Lisp system sets a tag {\ttfamily psl} on {\ttfamily lispsystem!*} and
the realistic use of this is to discriminate between CSL and PSL hosted
copies of Reduce.
\subsection{\ttfamily debug}
If CSL was compiled with debugging options this is present, and one can imagine
various bits of code being more cautious or more verbose if it is detected.
\subsection{\ttfamily (executable . name)}
The value is the fully rooted name of the executable file that was launched.
\subsection{\ttfamily fox}
Used to be present if the FOX GUI toolkit was detected and incorporated as
part of CSL, but now probably never used!
\subsection{\ttfamily (linker . type)}
Intended for use in association with {\ttfamily compiler!-command}, the value
is {\ttfamily win32} on Windows, {\ttfamily x86\_64} on 64-bit Linux and
other things on other systems, as detected using the program {\ttfamily
objtype.c}.
\subsection{\ttfamily (name . name)}
Some indication of the platform. For instance on one system I use it
is {\ttfamily linux-gnu:x86\_64} and on anther it is just {\ttfamily win32}.
\subsection{\ttfamily (native . tag)}
One of the many experiments within CSL that were active at one stage but are
not current involved compilation directly into machine code. The strong
desire to ensure that image files coudl be used on a cross-platform basis
led to saved compiled code being tagged with a numeric ``native code tag'',
and this key/value pair identified the value to be used on the current
machine.
\subsection{\ttfamily (opsys . operating-system)}
Some crude indication of the host operating system.
\subsection{\ttfamily pipes}
In the earlier days of CSL there were computers where pipes were not
supported, so this tag notes when they are present and hance the facility
to create sub-tasks through them can be used. 
\subsection{\ttfamily record\_get}
An an extension to the CSL profiling scheme it it possible to compile
a special version that tracks and counts each use of property-list access
functions. This can be useful because there are ways to give special
treatment to a small number of flags and a small number of properties. The
special-case flage end up stored as a bitmap in the symbol-header so avoid
need for property-list searching. But of course recording this extra
information slows things down. This tag notes when the slow version is
in use. It might be used to trigger a display of statistics at the end of
a calculation.
\subsection{\ttfamily reduce}
This is intended to report if the initial heap image is for Reduce rather than
merely for Lisp.
\subsection{\ttfamily (shortname . name)}
Gives the short name of the current executable, without its full path.
\subsection{\ttfamily showmath}
If the ``showmath'' capability has been compiled into CSL this will be present
so that Lisp code can know it is reasonable to try to use it.
\subsection{\ttfamily sixty!-four}
Present if the Lisp was compiled for a 64-bit computer.
\subsection{\ttfamily termed}
Present if a cursor-addressable console was detected.
\subsection{\ttfamily texmacs}
Present if the system was launched with the {\ttfamily --texmacs} flag.
The intent is that this should only be done when it has been launched with
texmacs as a front-end.
\subsection{\ttfamily (version . ver)}
The CSL version number.
\subsection{\ttfamily win32}
Present on Windows platforms, both the 32 and 64-bit variants!
\subsection{\ttfamily windowed}
Present if CSL is running in its own window rather than in console mode.




\section{Flags and Properties}

The tags here are probably not much use to end-users, but I am noting them
as a matter of completeness.

\subsection{\ttfamily s!:ppchar and \ttfamily s!:ppformat}
These are used in the prettyprint code found in {\ttfamily extras.red}. A
name is given a property {\ttfamily s!:ppformat} if in prettyprinted display
its first few arguments should appear on the same line as it if at all
possible. The {\ttfamily s!:ppchar} property is used to make the display of
bracket characters a little more tide in the source code.
\subsection{\ttfamily switch}
In the Reduce parser some names are ``switches'', and then directives such
as {\ttfamily on xxx} and {\ttfamily off xx} have the effect of setting or
clearing the value of a variable {\ttfamily !*xxx}. This is managed by
setting the {\ttfamily switch} flag om {\ttfamily xxx}. CSL sets some
things as switches ready for when they may be used by the Reduce parser.
\subsection{\ttfamily lose}
If a name is flagged as {ttfamily lose} then a subsequent attempt to
define or redefine it will be ignored.
\subsection{\ttfamily !$\sim$magic!-internal!-symbol!$\sim$}
CSL does not have a clear representation for functions that is separated from
the representation of an identifier, and so when you ask to get the value
of a raw function you get an identifier (probably a gensym) and this
tag is used to link such values with the symbols they were originally
extracted from.

\section{Functions and Special Forms}

Each line here shows a name and then one of the words {\ttfamily expr},
{\ttfamily fexpr} or {\ttfamily macro}. In some cases there can also be special
treatment of functions by the compiler so that they get compiled in-line.

\subsection{\ttfamily list!-modules expr}
This prints a human-readable display of the modules present in the current
image files. This will include ``InitialImage'' which is the heap-image
loaded at system startup. For example
\begin{verbatim}
> (list!-modules)

File d:\csl\csl.img (dirsize 8  length 155016, Writable):
  compat       Sat Jul 26 10:20:08 2008  position 556   size: 9320
  compiler     Sat Jul 26 10:20:08 2008  position 9880  size: 81088
  InitialImage Sat Jul 26 10:20:09 2008  position 90972 size: 64040

nil
\end{verbatim}

See {\ttfamily library!-members} and {\ttfamily modulep} for functions that
make it possible for Lisp code to discover about the loadable modules that are
available.
