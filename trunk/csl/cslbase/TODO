Priority List
=============


Some more *TESTING*


Full List
=========


Effect of end-of-file, and Windows/Unix compatibility thereof, but
now ^D is reasonably treated (I think!) in FOX-mode. In line-mode ^D
does not seem to behave as EOF...
   [I am not certain that they behave the same at present]

C "strict aliasing rules" reviewed. [I tell gcc not to use strict-aliasing
     but other C compilers may and the effects seem dire]


can I always scroll back to very top of buffer?

start-minimised to minimise before even showing the window. [seems hard]
review linkage between FILE/TOFILE and Lisp-level (spool ...)

tool-tips for menus?

Greek char support for benefit of ML? [irrelevant for Reduce!]
