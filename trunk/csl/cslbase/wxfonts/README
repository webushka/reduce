Each font-set used here has an associated README file that gives
information about where it came from and the license terms that
permit use.

The fonts provided here, and plausible uses for them are:

Computer Modern Unicode Typewriter
    This is a fixed-pitch Unicode font suitable for a terminal window.
The shapes are as for the Computer Modern typewriter face, but this has
a good range of accented, Greek, Cyrilic  and special characters.

AR PL New Sung (Fireflysung)
    A serif font that provides respectable coverage of the CJK pages of
Unicode. My thoughts are that I would just use it to extend coverage to
those parts of the Unicode range.

STIXxxx
    A range of 29 serif fonts, with Bold, Italic and BoldItalic variants.
The initial parts of the font are along the lines of Times or Computer
Modern Roman, but the coverage extents well into the rest of Unicode.
Character shapes as from many TeX mathematical fonts (eg maths italic,
blackboard, gothic, script) are provided in the block from U+1d400. Note that
that is not in the basic multilingual plane. A wide range of mathematical
symbols are present in STIXGeneral-Regular. STIXSizeOneSym and others include
the building blocks that might otherwise have been in "cmex10" for creation
of big delimiters, and cope with the provision of parantheses, brackets and
braces in a range of sizes. This will be the workhouse font set for typesetting
mathematics.



In previous revisions of the font-set here I had included variants on the
BaKoMa tex fonts - I now hope to use STIX instead. I had included some
of the Latin Modern fonts - same explanation of why they are no longer here.
Deja Vu Sans Mono might have been a sans-serif alternative to CMU Typewriter
and the two fonts do not have quite the same coverage so use of both could
fill some gaps - but for now I count that as more complication than it is
worth. I used to have some sazanami CJK fonts but keeping just fireflysung
simplifies things for me.
