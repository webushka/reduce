# This script can be passed the flag "--with-xp64" which will cause it to
# assume it is running on cygwin with the Microsoft 64-bit compilers
# set up for cross-compilation! Well actually I will recognize any flag with
# the string "xp64" in it...
#
# Note that getting the Microsoft C compilers and DDK on the PATH and
# having cygwin available too is a somewhat odd configuration and is not
# expected to make sense to casual users.
#
# The flag "--with-cygwin" is also only sensible if building on Windows.
# It disables the normal "-mno-cygwin" usage and so will lead to libraries
# that rely on cygwin1.dll
#
# "--enable-debug" does what you may expect. The library will be put in
# a directory with "-debug" fillowing the machine-triple.
#
# "--arch=dir" gives a name for the directory to put the build
# version of FOX in and this overrides my careful evaluation of my
# environment here.
#
# Any other option is expected to be a FOX version number.
