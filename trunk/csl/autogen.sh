# This re-creates all the "configure" scripts and the like. It is needed
# because I am not using autoconf's own mechanisms for sub-directories
# and so doing an autoreconf once at the top-level is not enough.

# I arrange that this script can be invoked from anywhere because it will
# possibly be called when the current directory is the BUILD directory
# not the SOURCE one. But this updates files in the SOURCE directory.

# The flags to autoreconf indicate
#   -i    install fresh copies of all relevant script-files etc
#   -f    force all updates regardless of date-stamps
#   -v    display some information about what is being done.
