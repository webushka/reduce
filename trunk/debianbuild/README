This directory contains everything necessary to build Debian/Ubuntu
packages for REDUCE. To use it, you should have already installed the 
package

  devscripts

To build the package, run the following command from the debianbuild/reduce
directory:

  debuild -B -uc -us

At the moment, this is an unsigned (switches -uc -us) binary package
(-B switch), although it contains the files from the packages directory. 

After successful completion, you may check the package content with

  dpkg --contents reduce_20120514_i386.deb

Install the package with

  dpkg --install reduce_20120514_i386.deb

An rpm package can be built from this by running (You need Ubuntu packages 
fakeroot and alien)

 fakeroot alien -r -k reduce_20120514_i386.deb

The CSL and PSL versions of REDUCE are run with

  /usr/bin/redpsl 

and 
  
  /usr/bin/redcsl

respectively.
