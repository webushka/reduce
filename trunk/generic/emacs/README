GNU Emacs REDUCE Integrated Development Environment:
Major Modes for Editing and Running REDUCE Source Code

REDUCE IDE is a package that provides an Integrated Development
Environment for the REDUCE computer algebra system within the GNU
Emacs editor. Its two major components are Emacs Lisp libraries that
provide major modes for respectively editing REDUCE source code and
running a *command-line version* of REDUCE in an Emacs window.
However, many of the facilities require that Emacs is running under a
GUI such as Microsoft Windows, or the X Window System under some
flavour of UNIX or Linux.

REDUCE IDE requires GNU Emacs 21 or later. I don't explicitly support
XEmacs.

All files should in principle be OS-independent. However, the
environment I use currently consists of Microsoft Windows 7, a recent
version of the native Windows port of GNU Emacs, and Cygwin for other
GNU software. I probably can't help with problems that are specific to
a different setup, especially a different OS.

This release is essentially a lightly edited updated for SourceForge
of the files formerly available from
http://centaur.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Emacs/REDUCE_IDE/, which I last
updated around 2001. The current update is mainly to the comments and
documentation to update my contact details and the status of REDUCE,
plus some enhancements to reduce-mode.el by Thomas Sturm.

Description of Distributed Files

Required:

reduce-mode.el		- REDUCE source editing mode

Optional:

reduce-run.el		- runs REDUCE in an Emacs buffer
reduce-ide.texinfo	- texinfo documentation source

The above files are all more-or-less human-readable. There are
detailed installation instructions in reduce-ide.texinfo (but for now
ignore the suggestion to use reduce-ide-install.el) and brief
installation instructions as comments near the start of the ELisp
files.

In a nutshell, byte-compile the ELisp files and ensure that they are
in your Emacs lisp load path. Then you can at least explicitly switch
to reduce mode to edit a file of REDUCE source code.

You can generate documentation in various formats, including info,
html and pdf, from reduce-ide.texinfo, but you need the GNU Texinfo
package; see http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/. If you have TeX
installed then it might include Texinfo (possibly as an optional
package); e.g. MiKTeX for Windows offers the main components. To
generate info or html it is probably best to run makeinfo; to generate
pdf you need to run TeX, possibly indirectly, so you also need a TeX
installation. For further details, please read sections 20 to 22 of
the Texinfo manual, available online at
http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/. For a quick
summary, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texinfo.

At some later date I might release an installer (that works) and/or a
a package containing the documentation in various formats and/or put
the documentation online via the REDUCE web site.
