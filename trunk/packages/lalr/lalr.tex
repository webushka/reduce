The code here is, at the time of writing, work in progress and
is buggy and incomplete!

This code serves the same sort of purpose as the well known utilities
\verb+yacc+ and \verb+bison+, in that it accepts a specification of a
contex free grammar and builds a parser for the language that it describes.
The techniques used are those described in standard texts (eg Aho, Lam,
Sethi and Ullman) as ``LALR''.

When the code is more fully operational I will extend this document to
provide further explanation of how to use it, and will include example
grammars that it can accept. Meanwhile read the source code and the
test script.
