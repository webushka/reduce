% Prolog III. Communications of the ACM. 33(7), 70-90, July 1990
% Description of the problem on p.79: Consider the infinite sequence
% of real numbers defined by x_{i+2}:=|x_{i+1}|-x_i where $x_1$ and
% $x_2$ are arbitrary numbers. Our aim is to show that this sequence
% is always periodic and that the period is 9, in other words that the
% sequences $x_1, x_2, \dots$ and $x_{1+9}, x_{2+9}, \dots$ are always
% identical.
