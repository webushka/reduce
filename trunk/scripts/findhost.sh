# Usage
#     ./findhost.sh $host <args to ./configure>
# OR  ./findhost.sh $host --short

# The idea here is that I want to name the directory by the Linux
# distribution or other OS variant, and tag on parts that indicate
# key configuration flags. This is necessary because 

# I want this script to be one I can launch from anywhere, but at least
# some of its sub-scripts will not be so generous. So find out where it
# lives so that other locations can be found relative to that.
