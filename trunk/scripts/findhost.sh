# Usage
#     ./findhost.sh $host <args to ./configure>
# OR  ./findhost.sh $host --short

# The idea here is that I want to name the directory by the Linux
# distribution or other OS variant, and tag on parts that indicate
# key configuration flags. This is necessary because 

# I want this script to be one I can launch from anywhere, but at least
# some of its sub-scripts will not be so generous. So find out where it
# lives so that other locations can be found relative to that.

# The exact transformations I apply are a matter of taste, I think. I

# that because Linux binaries do not guarantee compatibility between
# distributions or even from release to release within a distribution.
# Well things are a LOT better than they used to be, but I still do not
# believe it is perfect. Hence the mere tag "linux-gnu" is inadequate.
