# Here a there does not seem to be a version made for the EXACT operating
# system version that we are running on at present. So to try to be kind I
# will try to see if there is one for a version that may be related. In this
# case "related" should mean using the same CPU (eg as in i686 vs x86_64)
# and with the same "OS vendor" (eg debian, ubuntu, fedora etc). The effect
# is intended to be that if you have installed say a version intended for
# ubuntu 8.10 while in fact you are now running ubuntu 9.04 then things
# will work. But because there is a potential conflict here (eg a version
# built for fedora 9 might now work on fedora 2) I will display an alert 
# about the possible issue. Furthermore in this case (because I would like
# you to install a version exactly matching your operating system) I will
# not update the run script and so will do the tedious search every time.
